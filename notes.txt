----GOOD PLANNING - notes from How to Design Programs / HtDP
TIPS
	1. Keep a wish list around and as long as it's not empty, work from it
	2. One function per task
	3. Focus on the why, not how, especially in the purpose statement.
Do not pay attention to how until you need to. (Especially for recursion.)
	4. For some list processing you may want to ensure
a list is non-empty before working with it.

WISH LIST
	1. meaningful name for the function
	2. signature (consume/produce)
	3. purpose statement

SHORT DESIGN RECIPE
	1. analyze problem
	2. write what kind of data is consumed and produced, what is computed, and write a stub/signature
	3. work through examples
	4. outline the function
	5. flesh out the function
	6. test

FUNCTION DESIGN RECIPE
	1. tentative function-name and multi-line comment
	2. sentence(s) on what it's supposed to, especially in terms of data
	3. data definitions/context--what kind of data, and what it represents
	4. parameters and return statement
	5. one-line purpose
	6. improve function name
	7. delete sentence(s) from step 2
	6. generate examples as given:/expect:
	7. convert simpler examples to test(s)
	8. develop the function
	9. pass those test(s)
	10. convert more examples into tests
	11. develop the function
	12. pass those tests
	13. move the tests into a testing file and rerun them there
	14. clean up the function

# TESTING IMPORTS
# First, test main.py itself, with this
hash_ex = Hash()
print(str(hash_ex))
# Then test imports in other modules. the below strategy is adequate:
# put the following in main.py
from tests.algorithms_tests import *
from tests.hash_tests import *
truck_test()
cli.cli_test()
algorithms_tests_test()
general_tests_test()
hash_test()
# put in truck.py
def truck_test():
    function_for_testing_imports('1')
# put in cli.py
def cli_test():
    function_for_testing_imports('2')
# put in tests/algorithms_tests
def algorithms_tests_test():
    function_for_testing_imports('3')
# put in tests/general_tests
def general_tests_test():
    function_for_testing_imports('4')
# put in package
def function_for_testing_imports(param):
    print(f"well hello there{param}")
# put in hash
def hash_test():
    hash_ex = Hash()
    print(f"called from hash_tests, here's a hash: {str(hash_ex)}")
