TODO list
For better code but ~same functionality:

- Hash: adjust __setitem__ to reduce count when replacing
items that themselves were Hashes (and which thus contributed
> 1 to self._count). This is not a critical bug--it would just
lead to unnecesarily large __props.

- Hash: _flatten and _deepcopy could both be made shorter

- Truck and Package: pass destination-correction time from
update_corrected_packages to Package's
update_wrong_destination_as_corrected and have that method
append a history record to indicate when the delivery-status
changed from wrong-destination to at-hub.

- Add TESTS!
	- Hash and Regex: convert tests to Python's built-in
	unittest or an actual testing module instead of my sad
	current print-statement crutches.
	- Algorithms': add automated tests route_builder and
	route_helpers
	- General: add automated tests that walk through the whole
	app from start to finish ('integration' test(s))
