TODO list
For better code but ~same functionality:

Minor stuff:
------------
- Print functionality: there are many possibilities:
	- Say "Press Enter to continue" instead of showing it all at once!
	- Use terminal get-window size IN ORDER TO
		- get width and then replace all my carefully-manually-inserted
		newlines with (80% width) or something like that

- Refactor main and/or Truck and/or route_builder to not use hardcoded 8:00 AM value for first delivery time.

- Hash: adjust __setitem__ to reduce count when replacing
items that themselves were Hashes (and which thus contributed
> 1 to self._count). This is not a critical bug--it would just
lead to unnecesarily large __props.

- Hash: _flatten and _deepcopy could both be made shorter

- Truck and Package: Use the IN_TRANSIT Package Enum state!
Turns out I totally forgot to use it!

- Truck and Package: pass destination-correction time from
update_corrected_packages to Package's
update_wrong_destination_as_corrected and have that method
append a history record to indicate when the delivery-status
changed from wrong-destination to at-hub.
