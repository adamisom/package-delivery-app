def Package/__init__(self, a, c, st, z, d, w, sn, destination):
    '''Create Package object.
    Called in/by: load.py ~??
    Things it should do (remember, one function per task):
        self.set_initial_status(self.mark_pkg(self.parse_special_note(sn))))
          NOTE: these would go on the wish list, but I'll just copy/paste them
        add all passed-in properties
        add status property
        add history property
    '''
    pass


# Stray TODOs
# make new file enums.py and do from/import whenever Locations or PkgStatus
    # before I do that, I need python main.py to run - I need my stubs working
    # and before I do that, packages need to have special notes..lol
